## 1. What is Friend Circle

Friend Circle shows an aggregated feed from your blogroll. In this theme it appears on the Links page:

- `src/pages/links/index.astro`

## 2. Prepare the Data Source (Friend-Circle-Lite)

This theme consumes Friend-Circle-Lite data (like `all.json`). Reference setup guide:

- [Friend Circle: Setup & Configuration](https://blog.liushen.fun/posts/4dc716ec/)

You should end up with a domain like:

```txt
fc.example.com
```

and ensure this is accessible:

```txt
https://fc.example.com/all.json
```

## 3. Enable in the Theme

Edit `src/site.config.ts`:

- `theme.personal.domains.friendCircle = 'fc.example.com'`

After that, `/links` will automatically render the “Small Circle” section.

## 4. RSS Reminder

If a site is in your links but never shows up in the feed, it usually means its RSS is missing or unreachable.
