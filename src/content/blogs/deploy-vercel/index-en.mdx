## 1. Why GitHub + Vercel

- Preview deployments for every PR
- Push-to-deploy
- HTTPS + CDN out of the box

Reference walkthrough: [Website on Vercel](https://axi404.top/blog/website-vercel)

## 2. Preflight Checklist

Make sure it builds locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Set your domain (at least the main domain):

- `src/site.config.ts` → `theme.personal.domains.main`

## 3. Vercel Notes

This theme reads `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM` to pick adapter/output:

- `vercel` (default): Vercel adapter, usually `server` output
- `github`: GitHub Pages, `static` output
- `cloudflare`: Cloudflare Pages, `static` output

On Vercel, set:

```txt
DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM=vercel
```

Build command:

```txt
pnpm build
```

Keep the output directory setting as default (Astro is handled by the adapter).

## 4. Static Output (Optional)

If you need a fully static site (e.g. GitHub Pages), set:

```txt
DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM=github
```

and deploy the `dist/` output.
